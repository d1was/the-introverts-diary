So its a fullstop for 2019. A new paragraph starts in my chapter of responsibility. At the age of 21, i'm trying to blossom as wide as i can. I'm hustling to reach the height that i once dream of. With the collection of all the fears and excitement, i'm trying to row my boat just as fast as the clock tickles. I hope i enjoy this ride and this journey, doesn't matter i reach where i want to reach.

In no means am i an intresting person. I'm always pretty reserved and any other person in a same room with me is more charming and intresting.The only person whom i want to share what i want to share is me. Sometime it gets pretty difficult.And that's when i feel like i should write. I've bought a diary and used to write it there. After some week, my energy to pick a pen and make it dance around a paper was no where to be found. I can still see it lying in the table covered with dust with quarter of pages to get dirty. 

So i want to talk about 2019. I don't know how was it. I don't have many points to distribute. It was as quite as any other year for me. Nothing too fancy and nothing too excited. 

Starting in the positive note, i passed two semester this year(Sixth and Seventh). My father built a new house in Gauradha Bazaar, and my grandparents are living with us.I got a job in Software Development. I self managed my expenses(that was very satisfying). I started watching Naruto(i'm still watching and currently in 202 episode). I love naruto so much. I discovered music like AJJ, Gregory Alan Isakov, Mowgli, Mason Jennings, Prateek Kuhad. I watched many movies and tv series. My favourites are Mr Robot, Arrival, Breakfast Club, Taxi Driver, Peaky Blinders, Vikings, Hidden, The Truman Show etc. etc. My scope of programming has increased. I've been doing php and javascript this whole year. I broke my no fap record by going 36 days without nutting(previous 15). I didn't fall in love. I bought a harmonica and played the snurfkin medley which i've always dreamt of doing. I read books like Malala's auto bio, The perks of being a wallflower,  Jane Eyre, Priya Sufi and many self help books. The perks of being a wallflower was my best. 

On the low side, My grandparents are getting old and i missed them so much.Nothing i've loved more than them. I didn't improve in dealing with social anxiety. I had to move to new hostel leaving my beloved friend and family. I didn't fall in love. My hair's falling and i don't know how to stop. I overthinked so many things. Knowingly or unknowingly, may have i hurt any living souls, i am very sorry.
